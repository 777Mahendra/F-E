Developed a computer vision application to detect human faces and eyes from video input using pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers. The project involved:

1)Converting frames to grayscale and enhancing contrast using histogram equalization.

2)Detecting facial regions and overlaying ellipses to highlight identified faces.

3)Detecting eyes within detected face regions and marking them with circles.

4)Successfully processed and displayed detections frame-by-frame for uploaded videos using cv2.VideoCapture and Colab-compatible visualization (cv2_imshow).

5)This project demonstrates foundational expertise in image processing, object detection, and real-time video frame handling with OpenCV.
